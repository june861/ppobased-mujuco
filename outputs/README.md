# Outputs

This directory will contain the outputs of the runs (model weights, logs, etc.).

You can download `.csv` files of our raw logs as follows:
- Download the compressed file from [here](https://datasets.epfl.ch/claire/no-representation-no-trust-release/combined-raw-logs-compressed.tar.gz).
- Move it to the machine where you are running the experiments.
- extract it to `outputs/release-plotting/combined-raw-logs/` with
  `tar -xvf combined-raw-logs.tar.gz -C $PROJECT_ROOT/outputs/release-plotting/`.
